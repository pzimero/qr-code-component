## My process
I reviewed the solution photo and looked at what the finished application would look like. I decided to change the background color first
since that was the easiest thing to do for me. Another easy then I did was styled the fonts to mimic the final product. I realized that in order to achieve a white background for the images and the contents underneath it, I needed to create a div. Once I created the div, I added padding, margin, and height. I made sure to add shadowing for dimension. I made sure to add a media tag in css so that it is also viewable from a mobile device.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I always had trouble with flexbox and how to apply them into a project. I am poud that I was able to handle the html on my own but when it came to the css, I was having a hard time. I reviewed the mdn for css for a couple of days and then used codepen to visualize the how things where changing when using flexbox. There are many ways to put contents into the center and I found one something that works best for me in the way I can understand it. I am also getting used to understanding the workflow of a project. At first glance, I found the project to be intimidating but once I broke it down to pieces (body, h1, img), it was easy once I was organized with that I want to do first. 

```css
.body {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I am used to html, so for the next project, I want to challenge myself and push for another project that uses css. I have an idea of how most css elements and properties works, but I want to make sure I have a thorough understanding. Especially when it comes to flexbox and css grid. I welcome any and all advice, so if you have any tips for me please do not hestiate to reach out and let me know.

### Useful resources

- [Basic Concepts of Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) - This helped me for when I was stuck and did not grasp flexboxes. It is one of my favorite resources and I recommend this to beginners. It is lengthy but details and information included makes it worthy.
- [Codepen](https://codepen.io/) - I don't have an account, but I find this website super helpful to understand and apply concepts. I don't have to make an actual file, and I can make any changes without affecting my code that is on vscode.
